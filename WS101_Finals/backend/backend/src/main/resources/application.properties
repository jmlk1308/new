Smart choice. Since your MySQL database is already set up on Railway, staying there is the fastest way to get your project finished. Switching platforms now would just add new headaches.

To get those tables to show up, we need to treat this like a "Hard Reset." We are going to ensure the code and the Railway settings are perfectly in sync.

Step 1: The "Clean" application.properties
Delete everything in your current application.properties and paste this exact block. I have added the Dialect and Type settings which are often the "secret" to making MySQL work on cloud servers.

Properties

# 1. Server Port
server.port=${PORT:8080}

# 2. Database Connection
# This structure ensures Java knows it's a JDBC connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQLHOST:localhost}:${MYSQLPORT:3306}/${MYSQLDATABASE:learning_hub}?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=${MYSQLUSER:root}
spring.datasource.password=${MYSQLPASSWORD}

# 3. Hibernate (The Table Creator)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
